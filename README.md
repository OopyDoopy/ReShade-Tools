# ReShade-Tools
In this repository are a handful of scripts I've written to make life a bit easier for ReShade enthusiasts.  Enjoy!
# Download-Shaders
This script downloads all the well known shader repositories from github and organizes them in a reshade-shaders folder for you, fully collapsed under Shaders and Textures folders.  The script is also capable of updating only preexisting shaders, for those that like to maintain a more curated list of shaders but want an easy way to ensure they have the latest versions available.
