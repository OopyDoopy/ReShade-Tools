# ReShade-Tools
In this repository are a handful of scripts I've written to make life a bit easier for ReShade enthusiasts.  Enjoy!
# Download-Shaders
This PowerShell script downloads all the well known shader repositories from github and organizes them in a reshade-shaders folder for you, fully collapsed under Shaders and Textures folders.  The script is also capable of updating only preexisting shaders, for those that like to maintain a more curated list of shaders but want an easy way to ensure they have the latest versions available.  This script pairs well with the Install-Reshade script, though it can be used standalone as well.

*This script is not compatible with the reshade-shaders folder generated by a normal reshade install due to differences in folder structure.*

**How to use:**

  Drop the script in the directory you'd like to create \reshade-shaders\ in.  Right click, "Run with PowerShell", and complete the prompts.
# Install-Reshade
This Bash script enables you to far more easily use reshade from a centralized location.  It should get you most of the way there on Linux installs as well!  This script requires a bit of setup, but once that's done it's a lightning fast way to install reshade.
Since I'm not a Linux user (not for gaming anyway), I'll need user feedback for how to improve that experience.

**Features:**
  * Centralized Reshade dlls deployed via symlinks (update reshade dlls in one location!)
  * Download the latest ReShade dlls straight from the website and extract them to the centralized location.
  * Centralized Presets and Screenshots folder, with subfolders per-game.  No more will you accidentally delete a preset by uninstalling a game.
  * Uses a centralized reshade-shaders folder
  * Sets up your reshade.ini for you based on the above features.

**Prerequisites:**

  1.) You'll need a means of executing a Bash script (I recommend Git Bash - https://gitforwindows.org/ since it's easy to setup). Install with defaults AND symlink support.
  
  2.) Because Windows tightly manages who can create symlinks, you'll need to do one of the following things for symlink functionality to work (Linux users can ignore this):
  
    A.) Execute the script as administrator every time you run it.  If you can't right click and execute as admin, you'll need to execute the script from an elevated Git Bash terminal.
    
    B.) Enable UWP Developer Mode.  To do this, open the start menu and type developer settings.  The option is available there.  For some reason this setting also allows admin accounts to create symlinks.  Security implications are extremely minimal, this is the method I use.
    
  2.) You'll also need 7-Zip (https://www.7-zip.org/) installed.  By default, it's configured to work with the default install path for Windows machines.  If you have 7-Zip setup in your PATH variables, edit the variable at the top of the script to be empty (if you don't know what this means and you're on Windows, ignore it).
  
**Initial Setup:**

  1.) Open the script in the text editor of your choice (I recommend notepad++, but regular notepad will work fine if that's all you have).
  
  2.) Modify the paths to reflect the directories you'd like to use.<br>*Note: Any paths you include here will be generated for you, the directories don't need to exist in advance.*<br>*Note 2: If you use any modified ReShade dlls, you'll need to provide those yourself.*
    
**How to use:**

  1.) Place the script in the game directory with the game's .exe file.  Double click to execute (assuming Git Bash).
  
  2.) Follow the steps as they pop up in the terminal.
  
  3.) Reshade is installed!

# Install-Reshade-UWP (In testing)
Pretty happy to be the first person to try to make this less awful!  This script works similarly to the above script, but designed to make using reshade in UWP games much easier.  It includes all the features listed for Install-Reshade, and also shares the same requirements.

**Prerequisites:**

  1.) You'll need a means of executing a Bash script (I recommend Git Bash - https://gitforwindows.org/ since it's easy to setup). Install with defaults AND symlink support.
  
  2.) Because Windows tightly manages who can create symlinks, you'll need to do one of the following things for symlink functionality to work (Linux users can ignore this):
  
    A.) Execute the script as administrator every time you run it.  If you can't right click and execute as admin, you'll need to execute the script from an elevated Git Bash terminal.
    
    B.) Enable UWP Developer Mode.  To do this, open the start menu and type developer settings.  The option is available there.  For some reason this setting also allows admin accounts to create symlinks.  Security implications are extremely minimal, this is the method I use.
    
  2.) You'll also need 7-Zip (https://www.7-zip.org/) installed.  By default, it's configured to work with the default install path for Windows machines.  If you have 7-Zip setup in your PATH variables, edit the variable at the top of the script to be empty (if you don't know what this means and you're on Windows, ignore it).
  
**Initial Setup:**

  1.) Open the script in the text editor of your choice (I recommend notepad++, but regular notepad will work fine if that's all you have).
  
  2.) Modify the paths to reflect the directories you'd like to use.  The presets folder will be the working directory for reshade.<br>*Note: Any paths you include here will be generated for you, the directories don't need to exist in advance.*<br>*Note 2: If you use any modified ReShade dlls, you'll need to provide those yourself.*
  
**How to use:**

  1.) Place the script somewhere safe, you'll want to use it to setup any UWP game.  It can be executed from any location and function correctly.
  
  2.) Execute the script and *very carefully* follow the instructions.
  
  3.) Reshade is setup once the script is finished.  When done, a Powershell script will be generated on your Desktop.  This will be your new shortcut to launch the game with reshade.
  
**Planned Features:**
  
  * Attempt to parse the file for the relevant PackageFamilyName based on input from the user.
  * Attempt to guess which exe file to use for injection script, with the current manual method as a backup.  Many games, particularly UE4 titles, don't launch with the same exe that the game actually runs off of, which means this wouldn't always work.  Because of that, it's on the backburner.
  * Support multiple launch options in the generated powershell script itself (for example: Halo MCC supports launching with or without EAC enabled).  Currently, there's an accidental feature (definitely not a bug) that puts all launch options in the powershell script in a functional way, so you can swap out your launch options by editing the powershell script.
